JSON and datetime is a built-in module and typically does not require separate installation. 

To effectively run the code, the primary requirement is having Python installed on your computer, which serves as the programming language environment. Once Python is installed, you'll need to add some essential libraries to your environment. This is done using a package manager called pip, which simplifies the process of installing Python libraries. In this case, you'll want to install two specific libraries: requests and streamlit. 

With these steps completed, Python environment should be fully equipped to run the project smoothly.
